                Security auditing involves recognising, recording, storing,
                and analysing information related to security relevant
                activities (i.e. activities controlled by the TSF). The
                resulting audit records can be examined to determine which
                security relevant activities took place and whom (which user)
                is responsible for them.</para>

                CC audit families allow PP/ST authors the ability to define
                requirements for monitoring user activities and, in some
                cases, detecting real, possible, or imminent violations of
                the enforcement of the SFRs. The TOE's security audit functions are
                defined to help monitor security-relevant events, and act as a
                deterrent against security violations. The requirements of the
                audit families refer to functions that include audit data
                protection, record format, and event selection, as well as
                analysis tools, violation alarms, and real-time analysis. The
                audit trail should be presented in human-readable format
                either directly (e.g. storing the audit trail in

                a set of audit requirements that comply with the

                resulting in a deficient audit function (e.g. an audit

                        that the anomaly detector is actively updating the usage
                        profile based on new activity performed by the profile

                        representing user activity are defined by the PP/ST
                        author. For example, there may be a thousand different

                        In practice, it is at best rare when an analysis tool can
                        detect with certainty when a security violation is
                        imminent. However, there do exist some system events that

                        review. Example of such events include the deletion of a key

                        such as a remote user attempting to gain administrative

                    Non-repudiation of origin defines requirements to provide
                    evidence to users/subjects about the identity of the
                    originator of some information. The originator cannot
                    successfully deny having sent the information because
                    evidence of origin (e.g. digital signature) provides
                    evidence of the binding between the originator and the
                    information sent. The recipient or a third party can verify
                    the evidence of origin. This evidence should not be

                    In non-repudiation there are several different roles
                    involved, each of which could be combined in one or more
                    subjects. The first role is a subject that requests evidence
                    of origin (only in <xref show="link" id="fco_nro.1"/>). The second role
                    is the recipient and/or other subjects to which the evidence
                    is provided (e.g. a notary). The third role is a subject
                    that requests verification of the evidence of origin, for
                    example, a recipient or a third party such as an arbiter.</para>

                    The PP/ST author must specify the conditions that must be

                    example of a condition which could be specified is where the
                    verification of evidence must occur within 24 hours. These
                    conditions, therefore, allow the tailoring of the

                    instances, the PP/ST author does not want the user identity
                    to be exported. In that case the PP/ST author must consider
                    whether it is appropriate to include this class, or whether
                    the identity of the transport service provider or the

                    author might be more concerned about the time the
                    information was transmitted. For example, requests for
                    proposals must be transmitted before a certain date in order

                    received by the recipient. The recipient cannot successfully
                    deny having received the information because evidence of
                    receipt (e.g. digital signature) provides evidence of the
                    binding between the recipient attributes and the

                    In non-repudiation, there are several different roles
                    involved, each of which could be combined in one or more
                    subjects. The first role is a subject that requests evidence
                    of receipt (only in <xref show="link" id="fco_nrr.1"/>). The second role
                    is the recipient and/or other subjects to which the evidence
                    is provided, (e.g. a notary). The third role is a subject
                    that requests verification of the evidence of receipt, for
                    example, an originator or a third party such as an arbiter.</para>

                    The PP/ST author must specify the conditions that must be
                    met to be able to verify the validity of the evidence. An
                    example of a condition which could be specified is where the
                    verification of evidence must occur within 24 hours. These
                    conditions, therefore, allow the tailoring of the

                    instances, the PP/ST author does not want the user identity
                    to be exported. In that case, the PP/ST author must consider
                    whether it is appropriate to include this class, or whether
                    the identity of the transport service provider or the

                    information was received. For example, when an offer expires
                    at a certain date, orders must be received before a certain
                    date in order to be considered. In such instances, these

                A final aspect of this class is that it specifies access
                control in terms of ``operations''. An operation
                is defined as a specific type of access on a specific
                object. It depends on the level of abstraction of the PP/ST
                author whether these operations are described as
                ``read'' and/or ``write''
                operations, or as more complex operations such as

                The access control policies are policies that control access
                to the information container. The attributes represent
                attributes of the container. Once the information is out of
                the container, the accessor is free to modify that
                information, including writing the information into a
                different container with different attributes. By contrast, an
                information flow policies controls access to the information,
                independent of the container. The attributes of the
                information, which may be associated with the attributes of
                the container (or may not, as in the case of a multi-level
                database) stay with the information as it moves. The accessor
                does not have the ability, in the absence of an explicit
                authorisation, to change the attributes of the information.</para>

                This class is not meant to be a complete taxonomy of IT access
                policies, as others can be imagined. Those policies included
                here are simply those for which current experience with actual
                systems provides a basis for specifying requirements. There
                may be other forms of intent that are not captured in the

                For example, one could imagine a goal of having user-imposed

                automated implementation of the NO FOREIGN handling

                requirements for functions that may be implemented by a
                mechanism that also serves or could serve another purpose. For
                example, it is possible to build an access control policy
                (<xref show="link" id="fdp_acc"/>) that uses labels (<xref show="link" id="fdp_iff.1"/>) as the basis of the access control

                simultaneously, the PP/ST author must specify the name for
                each SFP, so it can be referenced in other families. This name

                it is being used as part of the definition of requirements for
                that SFP. This allows the author to easily indicate the

                    This family provides a PP/ST author the capability to
                    specify several policies, for example, a fixed access
                    control SFP to be applied to one scope of control, and a
                    flexible access control SFP to be defined for a different
                    scope of control. To specify more than one access control
                    policy, the components from this family can be iterated
                    multiple times in a PP/ST to different subsets of operations
                    and objects. This will accommodate TOEs that contain
                    multiple policies, each addressing a particular set of
                    operations and objects. In other words, the PP/ST author
                    should specify the required information in the ACC component
                    for each of the access control SFPs that the TSF will
                    enforce. For example, a TOE incorporating three access
                    control SFPs, each covering only a subset of the objects,
                    subjects, and operations within the TOE, will contain one

                    subjects. Some information flow control policies may be at a
                    very low level of detail and explicitly describe subjects in

                    input/output channels. If the information flow control

                    A TOE usually has a number of functions that potentially
                    de-allocate resources from an object and potentially re-allocate
                    those resources to objects. Some, but not all of those resources
                    may have been used to store critical data from the previous use
                    of the resource and for those resources FDP_RIP requires that
                    they are prepared for reuse. Object reuse applies to explicit
                    requests of a subject or user to release resources as well as
                    implicit actions of the TSF that result in the de-allocation and
                    subsequent re-allocation of resources to different
                    objects. Examples of explicit requests are the deletion or
                    truncation of a file or the release of an area of main
                    memory. Examples of implicit actions of the TSF are the
                    de-allocation and re-allocation of cache regions.</para><para type="normal">
                The requirement for object reuse is related to the content of
                the resource belonging to an object, not all information about
                the resource or object that may be stored elsewhere in the
                TSF. As an example to satisfy the FDP_RIP requirement for files
                as objects requires that all sectors that make up the file need
                to be prepared for re-use.</para>

                    It also applies to resources that are serially reused by
                    different subjects within the system. For example, most
                    operating systems typically rely upon hardware registers
                    (resources) to support processes within the system. As
                    processes are swapped from a ``run'' state to a ``sleep''
                    state (and vice versa), these registers are serially reused
                    by different subjects. While this ``swapping'' action may

                    true. For example, object ``A'' is a file and object ``B''
                    is the disk upon which that file resides. If object ``A'' is
                    deleted, the information from object ``A'' is under the

                sufficient control over the operation of the system.</para>

                In the components of this class there is flexibility as to
                whether or not authorised users are covered by the required
                security functionality. For example, a PP/ST author might
                consider it appropriate not to require protection of the privacy
                of users against a suitably authorised user.</para>
            <para type="normal" id="pgfId-9017">
                This class, together with other classes (such as those
                concerned with audit, access control, trusted path, and
                non-repudiation) provides the flexibility to specify the
                desired privacy behaviour. On the other hand, the requirements
                in this class might impose limitations on the use of the
                components of other classes, such as <xref show="link" id="fia"/> or <xref show="link" id="fau"/>. For example, if
                authorised users are not allowed to see the user identity
                (e.g. Anonymity or Pseudonymity), it will obviously not be
                possible to hold individual users accountable for any security
                relevant actions they perform that are covered by the privacy
                requirements. However, it may still be possible to include
                audit requirements in a PP/ST, where the fact that a
                particular security relevant event has occurred is more
                important than knowing who was responsible for it.</para>

                Unlinkability have a complex interrelationship. When choosing
                a family, the choice should depend on the threats
                identified. For some types of privacy threats, pseudonymity
                will be more appropriate than anonymity (e.g. if there is a
                requirement for auditing). In addition, some types of privacy
                threats are best countered by a combination of components from
                several families.</para>

                All families assume that a user does not explicitly perform an

                resistant. An example of an instantiation of anonymity could
                be: `` The TSF shall ensure that the users and/or

                    In several respects, pseudonymity resembles anonymity. Both
                    pseudonymity and anonymity protect the identity of the user,
                    but in pseudonymity a reference to the user's

                    identity. For the purpose of specifying requirements on this

                <para type="normal">
                    A way to use the reference is by being able to obtain the
                    original user identity. For example, in a digital cash
                    environment it would be advantageous to be able to trace the
                    user's identity when a check has been issued multiple times
                    (i.e. fraud). In general, the user's identity needs to be
                    retrieved under specific conditions. The PP/ST author might
                    want to incorporate <xref show="link" id="fpr_pse.2"/> to

                    Another usage of the reference is as an alias for a
                    user. For example, a user who does not wish to be
                    identified, can provide an account to which the resource
                    utilisation should be charged. In such cases, the reference
                    to the user identity is an alias for the user, where other
                    users or subjects can use the alias for performing their
                    functions without ever obtaining the user's
                    identity (for example, statistical operations on use of the
                    system). In this case, the PP/ST author might wish to
                    incorporate <xref show="link" id="fpr_pse.3"/> to specify the rules to
                    which the reference must conform.</para>

                    identity will be protected and, if so specified in the
                    condition, that there be a requirement to trace the user
                    identity if the digital money is spent twice. When the user
                    is honest, the user identity is protected; if the user tries
                    to cheat, the user identity can be traced.</para>

                    A different kind of system could be a digital credit card,
                    where the user will provide a pseudonym that indicates an
                    account from which the cash can be subtracted. In such
                    cases, for example, <xref show="link" id="fpr_pse.3"/> could be
                    used. This component would specify that the user identity

                    nor can the entity determine the subject or the owner of the

                    Unlinkability ensures that a user may make multiple uses of
                    resources or services without others being able to link
                    these uses together. Unlinkability differs from pseudonymity
                    that, although in pseudonymity the user is also not known,
                    relations between different actions can be provided.</para>
                <para type="normal" id="pgfId-10507">
                    The requirements for unlinkability are intended to protect
                    the user identity against the use of profiling of the
                    operations. For example, when a telephone smart card is
                    employed with a unique number, the telephone company can
                    determine the behaviour of the user of this telephone
                    card. When a telephone profile of the users is known, the
                    card can be linked to a specific user. Hiding the
                    relationship between different invocations of a service or
                    access of a resource will prevent this kind of information
                    gathering.</para>
                <para type="normal" id="pgfId-10521">
                    As a result, a requirement for unlinkability could imply
                    that the subject and user identity of an operation must be
                    protected. Otherwise this information might be used to link
                    operations together.</para>
                <para type="normal" id="pgfId-10522">
                    Unlinkability requires that different operations cannot be
                    related. This relationship can take several forms. For
                    example, the user associated with the operation, or the
                    terminal which initiated the action, or the time the action
                    was executed. The PP/ST author can specify what kind of
                    relationships are present that must be countered.</para>
                <para type="normal" id="pgfId-9314">
                    Possible applications include the ability to make multiple
                    use of a pseudonym without creating a usage pattern that
                    might disclose the user's identity.</para>
                <para type="normal" id="pgfId-9315">
                    Examples for potential hostile subjects and users are
                    providers, system operators, communication partners and
                    users, who smuggle malicious parts, (e.g. Trojan Horses)
                    into systems, they do not operate but want to get
                    information about. All of these attackers can investigate
                    (e.g. which users used which services) and misuse this
                    information. Unlinkability protects users from linkages,
                    which could be drawn between several actions of a
                    customer. An example is a series of phone calls made by an
                    anonymous customer to different partners, where the
                    combination of the partner's identities might disclose the

                            Unobservability relevant information (e.g. information
                            that describes that an operation occurred) can be
                            allocated in several locations within the TOE. The

                    This family provides requirements for the availability of
                    capabilities even in the case of failures. Examples of such
                    failures are power failure, hardware failure, or software
                    error. In case of these errors, if so specified, the TOE
                    will maintain the specified capabilities. The PP/ST author
                    could specify, for example, that a TOE used in a nuclear
                    plant will continue the operation of the shut-down procedure

                <para type="normal" id="pgfId-3699">
                    Because the TOE can only continue its correct operation if
                    the SFRs are enforced, there is a requirement that the system
                    must remain in a secure state after a failure. This

                    The mechanisms to provide fault tolerance could be active or
                    passive. In case of an active mechanism, specific functions
                    are in place that are activated in case the error
                    occurs. For example, a fire alarm is an active mechanism:
                    the TSF will detect the fire and can take action such as
                    switching operation to a backup. In a passive scheme, the
                    architecture of the TOE is capable of handling the
                    error. For example, the use of a majority voting scheme with
                    multiple processors is a passive solution; failure of one
                    processor will not disrupt the operation of the TOE

                    The objective of these components is to ensure a certain

                    should not allocate all the available space) and
                    subjects. Since resource allocation often goes beyond the
                    lifespan of a subject (i.e. files often exist longer than
                    the applications that generated them), and multiple
                    instantiations of subjects by the same user should not
                    negatively affect other users too much, the components allow
                    that the allocation limits are related to the users. In some
                    situations the resources are allocated by a subject
                    (e.g. main memory or CPU cycles). In those instances the

                    This family provides the capability for a PP/ST author to
                    specify requirements for the TSF to place limits on the
                    domain of an authorised user's security attributes
                    based on an environmental condition. For example, a user may
                    be allowed to establish a ``secret session''
                    during normal business hours but outside those hours the
                    same user may be constrained to only establishing
                    ``unclassified sessions''. The identification of
                    relevant constraints on the domain of selectable attributes
                    can be achieved through the use of the selection
                    operation. These constraints can be applied on an
                    attribute-by-attribute basis. When there exists a need to
                    specify constraints on multiple attributes this component
                    will have to be replicated for each attribute. Examples of
                    attributes that could be used to limit the session security

                Users often need to perform functions through direct

                is invoked. A user's response via the trusted path
